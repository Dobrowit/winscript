## Features

- 🧹 **Debloat**: Remove Windows bloatware, CoPilot, Edge, OneDrive & pre-installed features.
- 🔏 **Privacy**: Disable Windows and 3rd party telemetry & data collection, tracking, app access & more.
- 🚀 **Performance**: Set background services to manual to free resources, set your preferred DNS, clean temp files & more.
- ⬇️ **Install Apps**: Install all your favourite apps simultaneously in one click through chocolatey.

## Usage

**WinScript must be run as Administrator to work properly.** <br>
_The desktop app may be flagged as a threat by Windows Defender; however, this is a false positive. This occurs because the scripts you create with WinScript can modify system settings. Rest assured, WinScript is safe, transparent, and open-source._
