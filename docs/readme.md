## What is it?

WinScript is an open-source tool to build your Windows 10/11 script from scratch.
It features debloat, privacy, performance & app installing scripts.

## Why should i use it?

Windows collects extensive user data through telemetry, including location, browsing history, and app usage, often without clear consent, raising privacy concerns. You can improve your privacy by using WinScript, which allows you to disable telemetry and data collection. But it's not just about privacy. <br> Windows has become more and more bloated each update, with Microsoft forcing you to use Edge, CoPilot, seeing ads in the OS and other anti-user practices. With WinScript you can safely debloat your system, apply performance tweaks and more, but the best thing about WinScript that separates it from other Windows scripts is that you review each line of the script before executing it, so that you know exactly what is being done to your PC.

## Is it Open-Source?

WinScript is an open-source project licensed under GPL-3.0. It's completely free to use and transparent. If you want to contribute, please check the contributing guide.
